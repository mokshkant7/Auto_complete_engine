# Auto_complete_engine

The .cpp file works directly with the wordlist. (made on mac so change .rtf to .txt for windows and make this change in 
the program as well)

The base made in Flutter is not linked and doesn't work yet so no need for flutter to implement this.
Can directly work with the terminal.
